#Sassy-Art (Styling Rails Apps with SASS)

This is a sample Rails app (limited functionality -- Index action only) designed for the SASS lesson. 

You should be able to do a ```git pull``` and then a ```bundle install``` and ```rake db:seed``` to get this up and running. (If you have trouble with Mongoid, remove the Gemfile.lock and take the github reference out of the Gemfile, then re-bundle!)

As a class, we'll use SASS to style the app together and highlight some of the things you can do.

Feel free to use this app as additional Rails practice after the lesson (finish out CRUD functionality, style some views differently, etc.).
